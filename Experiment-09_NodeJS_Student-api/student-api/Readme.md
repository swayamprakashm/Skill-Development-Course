## **PROGRAM 9 – RESTful Student API with Node.js and Express**

---

### **AIM**

To implement a **RESTful API** for managing student data using **Node.js** and **Express**.

---

### **DESCRIPTION**

This experiment demonstrates how to build a simple REST API using **Node.js** and **Express**. The API allows users to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on student records.

The data is stored **in-memory** for simplicity, simulating a backend service that can be extended with a database in real-world applications. This lightweight implementation is ideal for learning core API development concepts, including:

* Route handling
* JSON request/response processing
* Basic REST design principles

The solution uses **Express.js** for backend routing and **Node.js** as the runtime environment.

### **INSTALLATION & SETUP**

#### **PREREQUISITES**

• Node.js

• VS Code or any preferred text editor

---

### **STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT**

1. **Clone or Create the Project Folder**

```bash
mkdir student-api  
cd student-api
```

2. **Initialize Node.js Project**

```bash
npm init -y
```

3. **Install Express**

```bash
npm install express
```

4. **Create `server.js` File**
   Write your API logic in `server.js` (CRUD functionality for students).

5. **Start the Server**

```bash
node server.js
```

6. **Visit in Browser**

```
http://localhost:3000/api/students
```
